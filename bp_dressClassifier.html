              It's been two weeks since I finished my 5th semester. 
              I took CSC 2301 (Intelligent system) -an introductory course, 
              in the field of artificial intelligence. A project was required to be done as part of the course. 
              I have decided to create a model (basically image classifier)
              to distinguish between properly dressed students according to university dress-code from improperly dressed students. 
              This is real world problem and my university impose 50rm fine for improper dress attire (at times).
              My thought was to find out a solution using machine learning approach to prevent improperly attired students
              from entering some university facilities such as library, labs and so on. As time is too sort and the project not expected to be that much big by the course,
              so I started to collect some data (off course itâ€™s the picture of students). 
              It was the hardest part of the project. 
              I realize data is the most precious thing. Somehow, I manage to gather some data and was looking for implementation. 
              There are a lot of resources available for image classifier. 
              As my purpose was to explore and learn as much as possible, below is the small effort towards building ML model.
